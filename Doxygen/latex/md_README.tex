Djeye-\/controller is a MIDI controller which interface is thought to be easy to use through input coming from an eye tracker. It is written in c++ using the \href{https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE}{\texttt{ JUCE}} library. To use the eye-\/tracker see \href{https://gitlab.com/djeyes/tobii-eye-interface}{\texttt{ Tobii-\/eye-\/interface}}.  \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
